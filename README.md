# Java Console Applications

This repository contains multiple **Java console-based applications**, each built for learning, practice, and demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.  

## Applications Included
- **ATM Application** – Simulates ATM operations such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, and PIN verification.  
- **Hospital Management System** – Manages patient details, doctor appointments, and billing.  
- **Library Management System** – Handles book records, borrowing/returning, and member management.  
- **Restaurant Billing System** – Simulates menu ordering, bill generation, and payment.  
- **Student Attendance System** – Records and tracks student attendance with reports.  
- **Theater Ticket Booking System** – Manages movie listings, seat bookings, and ticket generation.
